	<p class = "bio">My name is Harsh Prajapati. I am currently a sophomore at Tufts University studying computer science. I was born in Ahmedabad, India and moved here at a very early age. I was raised in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. I am a first generation college student. Growing up, I loved playing basketball. My dream was to become the first NBA basketball player. Clearly that didn't end up working out. ðŸ¤£ My other passion has always been math and science. Hence, I've always known that if basketball didn't work out, I would go into engineering. This explains why I have chosen to do computer science through the engineering school. Although, my basketball career was discontinued, I continue to play basketball in my free time. However, my dream now is to own my own tech firm one day, as well as own a casino before I retire. These pictures sum everything up.</p>
